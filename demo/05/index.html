    We're switching from platform.js to polymer.js here.

    platform.js provides the polyfills which support the specification, however
    Polymer adds an opinion layer which offers a much simpler API for some
    operations.

    Think of it as being similar to using jQuery's $.on() rather than native
    addEventListener.

    In this case we use it to register custom elements.

  <script src="/polymer/polymer.js"></script>

  <!--

    Custom elements allow you to encapsulate styling and functionality inside a
    new HTML tag. For this demo I used Polymer's approach, which takes the
    child <template> from a custom element and creates a shadow root out of it.

    Shadow roots act like a totally separate embedded DOM. By default not much
    can cross the boundary between a shadow DOM and its host DOM, but this can
    be configured by programatically changing the properties of the shadow root
    object.
